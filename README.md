# Predictive Modeling of NFL Player Tracking Data Using Transformers üèà

## Overview
This project applies **transformer-based models** to predict **offensive formations and player movements** using **NFL player tracking data**. It leverages **deep learning** and **time-series forecasting** to enhance game strategy analysis. 

## Features
- Utilizes **transformers** for time-series forecasting of player movements.
- Incorporates **advanced visualizations** for tracking offensive and defensive formations.
- Implements **sequence modeling techniques** to predict future game plays.

## Dataset
- The dataset includes **NFL player tracking data** from [NFL Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025).
- Preprocessed to extract **sequential movement data** for transformer models.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for preprocessing)

##  Notebook Details
The Jupyter Notebook (`modeling-with-transformers.ipynb`) covers:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and feature extraction from tracking data.
2. **Transformer Model Architecture**: Sequence modeling with **self-attention mechanisms**.
3. **Training & Evaluation**: Performance metrics and visualization of predictions.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting **player trajectories** for enhanced analysis.
